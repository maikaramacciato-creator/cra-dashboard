# CRA Assistant Dashboard — Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the CRA Assistant Dashboard — a smart, personal productivity tool designed by a Senior CRA to help manage clinical research work in a way that’s structured, flexible, and human.

---

## 🚀 How to Use the Dashboard

### 1️⃣ Customize Your Setup

* Click the **"Customize"** button (top right of the dashboard).
* Select your **time zone**. Currently supported:

  * `Europe/Stockholm`
  * `Europe/Helsinki`
  * `Europe/London`
  * `America/New_York`
* Add your study sites using the **"Add Site"** button. This will create a dedicated section for each site.

---

### 2️⃣ Add Tasks

You can add tasks in **two ways**:

#### 🔹 Smart Input (AI-style quick command)

* Simply type a command like:
  `Site 1234 PI to sign eCRF`

The dashboard will:

* Automatically assign a **category** (e.g., documentation, safety, IMP)
* Assign a **priority level** (urgent, medium, low)

This is based on built-in rules aligned with **GCP (E6/E3)**.

#### 🔹 Manual Entry

* Go to the relevant **site tab**
* Click **"Add Task"**
* Fill in the task details manually: description, priority, category, and time spent.

---

### 3️⃣ View and Edit Tasks

* All tasks appear under their respective site.
* Click the **"Edit"** button next to any task to:

  * Change the task description
  * Adjust priority or category
  * Update time spent

You can also:

* Mark a task as **Complete**
* Log **Next Visit** or **Last Visit**

---

### 4️⃣ Use Templates

You can save recurring messages as templates, such as:

* Email reminders to site staff about missing signatures
* Training invitations
* Instructions for document handling

These templates can be reused or shared with colleagues — perfect for onboarding new CRAs or keeping things consistent.

---

### 5️⃣ Generate Handover Summaries

If you're going on vacation or transitioning the study:

* Click the **"Generate Handover"** button
* You’ll get a clean summary of:

  * Open tasks
  * Priority levels
  * Site-specific status

You can copy, export, or share this handover summary easily.

---

## ⏱️ Work Hours, Focus & Overload Reminders

* Default working hours are: **Monday–Friday, 08:00–18:00**

* If you log tasks **outside normal hours** (e.g., weekend or late night), the system will gently alert you:

  > "*⚠️ You are working outside standard hours.*"

* If your active task list grows too long, you’ll get a soft nudge to re-prioritize:

  > "*⚠️ Too many open tasks. Consider taking a break or delegating.*"

---

## 💾 Saving & Accessing the Dashboard

* All data is saved **locally in your browser** (no cloud or external storage).
* Simply **bookmark or favorite the page** in your browser to return to it.
* Your data will persist **unless you clear your browser cache** or change devices.

---

## ⚠️ Limits & AI Boundaries

The system uses smart rules but does **not understand clinical context deeply**.\\

You can manually adjust anything that’s miscategorized.

---

## 🔐 Disclaimer

This tool is for **personal use by clinical research professionals** to support **non-regulated task management**.
It is a browser-based system that **auto-saves your data locally** and does not send information to external servers.
Use is at your own discretion and should comply with your organization's SOPs and data protection policies.
